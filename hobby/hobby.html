    <h2>Steins;gate</h2>
    <div class="detailleBoite">
      <p>
        The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou&nbsp;Okabe rents out a room
        in a rickety old building in Akihabara, where he indulges himself in his
        <br />hobby of inventing prospective "future gadgets" with fellow lab
        members: Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida
        <br />
        Itaru, a perverted hacker nicknamed "Daru." The three pass the time by
        tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine <br />
        dubbed the "Phone Microwave," which performs the strange function of
        morphing bananas into piles of green gel. Though miraculous in
        <br />itself, the phenomenon doesn 't provide anything concrete in
        Okabe's search for a scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab
        members <br />are spurred into action by a string of mysterious
        happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected successâ€”the Phone
        Microwave can send emails
        <br />
        to the past, altering the flow of history. Adapted from the critically
        acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes Okabe
        <br />
        through the depths of scientific theory and practicality. Forced across
        the diverging threads of past and present, Okabe must shoulder the
        <br />burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of time.
